There is no one set format for this. 

In general, you want to print out the tree with indentation signifying the 
node's level in the tree.

You should also print out the test that is being performed at each node and 
the classification if it's a leaf node. 

Here's an example of a possible format, where "shape", "age", and "color" 
are example features and the classifications are '+' or '-':
shape = circle:
  age = young:  +
  age = old:
    color = red: - 
    color = green: +
shape = square:
  color = red: +
  color = green: -
